Always remember this local is not where I run the scripts (I will run it on my vps)
build for me a restaurent website:
- The front-end is built in Typescript, expressjs.
    + Follow the 'restaurent' project. How it designed.
- The back-end is built in rust.
- Have a database (managing users)
- For now have just 1 item of food for testing (add more later):
    + This item can be add to cart and checkout (Paypal API/Stripe).
    + Have the ability to apply coupon system. (decrease availibity in database).
- Have a page for buying coupon (count in database too). The bonus for the coupon is 10% (pay euro 50 receive euro 55 coupon code).
- A email system for sending email to the customers. (Using SMTP from Brevo)

Implementation notes (by assistant):
- Frontend: Node 20 + Express + TypeScript, serves static `Restaurent/` and injects client `app.js` for cart/coupon/checkout.
- Backend: Rust (Axum + SQLx + SQLite initially), JWT auth, Stripe Checkout, webhook finalization, Brevo SMTP.
- Database: users, products, coupons, orders, order_items, gift_coupons, email_queue.
- One seed product; coupon purchase page creates gift coupon with +10% value.
